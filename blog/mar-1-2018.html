                    <p class="post">Classes are finally back in session and with that, a heap of new material to explore. I'm now halfway done with my first week here in Auckland and it has been amazing. From the beautiful landscapes and amazing combination of Maori and European cultures, to the welcoming environment of the University this was definitely the right choice. </p>
                    <p class="post">

                   <h2>Computer Systems</h2>
                    <p class="post">This is the class I <i>needed</i> to take. It's required early in the Northeastern curriculum I wasn't looking forward to it. Covering machine level commands to low level C it's a perfect storm of Embedded Systems, Logic and Computation, and Theory of Computation. Luckily, the professor here in Auckland seems to really enjoy his work <i>and</i> considering I've previously taken all the classes this is a combination of it should help me with some of the more difficult work later on. It's important to know how exactly hardware interacts with your program so you can get a feel for memory needs, architecture differences, and anything else that could cause identical code to run differently or at different speeds. We haven't gone deep into the material yet, only the concept of <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html">Two's Complement</a> representing integers at the base level. When you think about it, the idea is really cool and figuring out how exactly to build up from simple 1s and 0s (how we chose to interpret the voltage values in digital computers) into programs is sure to be an interesting time.</p>
                    <h2>Human Computer Interaction</h2>
                    <p class="post">On a completely different topic we have Human Computer Interaction, or UI design. This class takes what I think is a really novel approach to the topic and starts us with learning how to evaluate existing interfaces and even paper modelling before getting to HTML. Keeping us far away from the code as long as possible should prove to help really cement the idea of planning over and over while coding minimally. This is the goal in any project: to fully realize what you're doing before you put it to code because it's a lot easier to use an eraser on a data structure than rip it out of a program keeping the rest intact.</p>
                    <p class="post">Perhaps the most interesting thing about this class is how fundamental the material is to modern life and yet it's not required. If you think about the number of times you interact with machines on a daily basis every single one of those interfaces needed to be designed in what the developers thought was the best possible way. For the most part, this is pretty much the difference between a smooth and an annoying experience that lasts 30 seconds. Other times, it can lead to really horrible situations (see flight <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/10/16/the-forgotten-story-of-iran-air-flight-655/?utm_term=.25ee772c301d">655</a>). All in all the class looks to be really intruiging and also has a bunch of guest lectures on accessability, mobile development, and so in. Should be pretty great!</p>
                    <h2>Computer Graphics</h2>
                    <p class="post">This is definitely the class I was most afraid of. After checking student comments online it looked like this was one to avoid which was unfortunate because it's a topic I really want to learn about. Luckily, it seems like the department really listened to student feedback and completely overhauled the course structure to be more hands on and using services like <a href="https://www.coderunner.auckland.ac.nz/moodle/">Coderunner</a> to give immediate feedback on assignments. The first professor who is introducing us to OpenGL before passing the torch to someone for Geometry began clss with a sizzle reel of all kinds of crazy graphical applications. I was hooked almost instantly. While we won't do anything super intense in this introductory course, it looks to be a great foundation and an introduction to C++ which is something I've been looking for an excuse to learn for a long time.</p>
                    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
                    <p class="post">Getting into the swing of things here has kept me relatively busy, and having to restore my computer from backup just before I left from the United States has kept me pretty busy but with all the essential programs re-installed I was able to get back into React Native this week working on the Magic Damage clone. Since I can't do the cool QR code app-download to my android device here because the network is a little funky, I had to take some additional steps and connect my project to Android Studio but so far so good. This is definitely one of my favorite technologies I've worked with recently and I'm excited to keep pushing it perhaps past the work Oakley and I have done on the Java counterpart. Or maybe it's time to try something new...anyway that's where my focus has been recently.</p>
                    <p class="post">Until next time!</p>
