                    <p class="post">Sorry for the long hiatus, got a little absorbed into the rest of life using my free time to fill out a visa for a semester in <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">New Zealand</a>, and began looking at potential co-ops for next fall! Now back to the regularly scheduled programming.</p>
                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p class="post">When I was a senior in High School, I had an English class with one of my best friends. Towards the end of the year, we needed to design a final project about <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/harrypottermutilatedmemories/?source=directory"><i>Harry Potter</i></a>. We started by bouncing some ideas off each other such as a fancy map, maybe a piece of fan fiction...but eventually settled on creating a video game. Designing a game had been a dream of mine for quite some time so now having a team and a deadline finally brought it together. HPMM was born, a text adventure that dropped you in Hogwarts along with the whole regular gang. There were plenty of bugs, and the overall gameplay left something to be desired...but the process was one of the most fun I've had before or since. Building something that other people will enjoy and want to play again along with creating something that has enough secrets for me to excitedly point out whenever someone would playtest, whether they enjoyed the co-pilot or not. Since then I've been really trying to find a way to recreate that energy, and tie it into what I've been doing recently. So along with learning React from the Udemy course (updates coming soon!) I'm working on a text adventure that will eventually tie together with what I'm learning in my coursework. The game is going to start in plain old JavaScript but will eventually be updated to ES6 using Webpack with the long <i>long</i> term goal of creating a web app exclusively for the game interface. If you want to check it out before reading into some of the design, you can find the game <a href="/game.html">here</a>. Hope you like it! (For now if you try to acces the game page on mobile, it'll redirect to the source code on GitHub.)</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Build</h2>
                    <p class="post">From the start I knew I wanted to emulate the old command console on a webpage. That...was something I had absolutely no idea how to do. So I used Google, and settled on this amazing <a href="http://terminal.jcubic.pl/">jQuery library</a> to create a completely modifiable command line. This would more than do the job.</p>
                    
                    <p class="post">
                        <img src="/img/terminal.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="JavaScript Terminal">
                    </p>

                    <p class="post">Right now, this is the powerhouse of the whole project: Sure there's the class structure of the various environments the player will visit, and the player themselves for that matter but without a good system to interpret the input of the player all of that leads to fancy decorations for a house that doesn't exist. I hope to implement a more complex parser that does more than check against a case-sensitive list of commands...but future goals! Right now it does the job. Perhaps my favorite part though is you'll notice I have a for loop running through an array called "actions". This is no ordinary array, well okay maybe it is but I mean it's not a <i>static</i> array. Depending on the room, the current environment of the player, new actions are loaded into the "actions" array and giving new options to the player based on where they are with constant ones available for actions like "help."</p>
                    
                    <p class="post">
                        <img src="/img/load.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Loading Arrays">
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="post">Given a room object, this function re-assigns the actions array to include the information specific to the room and actions wanted for every room. You'll also see the effects array in better detail here. Effects is an array of functions that correspond directly by position to the actions array. Can you figure out why? When a player inputs a command that is recognized in the actions array, the interpertor (first picture) then runs the corresponding function. That way we can run effects based on String input. For the rest, you'll just have to give the game a go! </p>
