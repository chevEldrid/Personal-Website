                    <p class="post">Deciding on a new project can be a bit of a struggle. When it comes to Computer Science there really are infinite possibilites it seems, and chosing something to devote a lot of resources towards can be a really difficult decision. Maybe I focus on technologies that might be beneficial to more general software development careers, or perhaps I try something that just seems really really cool but could eventually fade away? I'm stuck between a couple different potential directions at the moment and thought maybe I'd talk them out!</p>
                    <h2>Option 1: Blockchain</h2>
                    <p class="post">Last week when I was bored I ended up down a <a href="https://bitkey.io/">blockchain rabbit-hole</a> that ended in me thinking about creating a very, very basic cryptocurrency myself. Why not? Learn the tech, give myself a lifetime supply in <a href="
                        https://medium.freecodecamp.org/from-what-is-blockchain-to-building-a-blockchain-within-an-hour-4e738efc819d">Chev-coin</a> that will one day be the only currency around...it could be great! In all seriousness, blockchain technology isn't going away anytime soon and could be a really viable skill going forward. That and I'm still trying to wrap my head around the actual technology behind it.</p>
                    <h2>Option 2: VR!</h2>
                    <p class="post">I've messed around somewhat with Android Studio before, primarily to build this really cool <a href="https://github.com/oakreid/Commander-Damage-Tracker">counter app</a> with my friend <a href="http://www.owreid.info/">Oakley</a>. This time, I want to try Cardboard. Yes, I'm a generation behind but so is my main testing device (my phone) so I'll start with Cardboard. Considering Google now has a <a href="https://poly.google.com/">3D Object Library,</a> AND <a href="https://developers.google.com/vr/android/get-started">very helpful tutorials</a> this could be really cool.</p>
                    <h2>Option 3: Web Scraper</h2>
                    <p class="post">Right before this website my big idea was creating a Python program that could tie my online <i>Magic the Gathering</i> online decklists to a database (group of excel sheets) on my computer. This was largely scrapped due to the fact <a href="http://tappedout.net/">Tapped Out</a> already has an online database with much of the same features I was going to create. This kind of put a damper in my attitude but the coolest aspect that I had merely touched the surface of was <a href="https://hackernoon.com/30-minute-python-web-scraper-39d6d038e5da">Web Scraping:</a> or creating a program that can access the majority of the web autonomously. I'm not entirely sure what direction this project would take but using this technology to grab data of some poiint would be the key, and again, a really cool concept!</p>
                    <p class="post">Those are the top three ideas I can think of...it's going to be hard but I think I'd rather choose one to focus on first. While I do have a habbit of starting a lot of things and finish none of them I'm trying to work on that, so starting now I'm going to see one of these through to completion! Tune in next week!</p>
