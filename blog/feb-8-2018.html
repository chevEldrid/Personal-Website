                    <p class="post">Tomorrow's the day!! Southern Hemisphere bound in approximately 24 hours. First we'll be spending some time in Perth,Australia before heading to New Zealand's Northern Island. I don't start classes for another three weeks and might spend a lot of time away from computers in that time. I'll update here when I can but also check out the more travel-focused site I run at <a href="http://chevstravels.blogspot.com">chevstravels.blogspot.com</a>! Hoping to do more regular updating there with journalistic-style entries.</p>
                    <h2>React Native</h2>
                    <p class="post">Today's topic: Javascript! In some of its infinite forms...If recall, a while ago I began some work with the React framework using a Udemy class (<a href="/blog/react.html">here</a>). Since then I've been a bit all over the place until I sat down with React Native yesterday. Now, the differences aren't extravagent but to the best of my understanding React Native has a much more pre-built feel allowing developers to immediately jump into designing cross-platform applications.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="post">For the most part this is it! Aside from a slight styling in CSS-esque syntax this is all the code needed to write and create an app very similar to the original Magic Life Counter app Oakley and I worked on last fall. Here is a picture of the React version so far:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="post">Aaaand here is a recent build of the Android Studio version minus the Reset and Menu buttons in the center:</p>
                    <p class="post">
                        <img src="/img/studioMTGApp.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Screen from MTG App">
                    </p>
                    <p class="post">Apart from some style and number of counters the overall look and feel is quite similar! The difference being the React clone was created in an afternoon using solely the "getting started" <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">documentation</a> from Facebook and a little fiddling with views. This is compared to the Android Studio build that involved some really in-depth digging through XML to figure out how to place additional buttons. Overall I'd say it was a much faster process using React and required much less tinkering with pre-built files. I look forward to continuing work on both to further compare the two platforms for app development</p>
                    <h2>Snowfall</h2>
                   <p class="post">So last week I mentioned I wanted to go into the Snowfall decision engine a little bit and explain the process used to parse user input. This idea has been with me from back when Julian and I designed <i>Harry Potter: Messed-Up Memories</i>, a very clumsy but fun take on old school text adventures back in High School. Since then, my code has become far more sophisticated but I managed to keep the same design philosphy. Is this the best way to do it? I'm not sure, but so far I have not found a decidedly better way.</p>
                    <p class="post">
                        <img src="/img/snowfallinput.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Screen from MTG App">
                    </p>
                    <p class="post">Depending on player position in-game, a different set of available actions are assigned to the commands ArrayList and it's this list that is checked every time a player submits a command. First, the user input is split into an array by spaces. Then, the game runs the first word of input against the command ArrayList looking for matches. If there is one, great! We've figured out what the user wants! The rest of the input is then stored as potential arguments (ex: "inpsect" is the command and the user said "inspect lighter" so "lighter" becomes an argument passed to the "inpsect" command) If a command is not recognized in the first word, the command ArrayList will then compare to the first <i>two</i> words of user input. This continues until all input is checked and finally if nothing matches, the game returns an error. This way, commands of any number of words or potential arguments can be used with little hassle! </p>
                    <p class="post">That's all for this week!</p>
