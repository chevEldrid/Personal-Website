I wanted to work in an industry that applied the methods I was taught but built off of them. So I accepted a position at GMO, an asset management company as part of the Data Governance team. I use mostly SQL and a Data management platform in my day-to-day. What I <i>really</i> want to do is continue adding automation to the Data Governance workflow, so far its all been in-platform but I look forward to learning about API connectivity in creating external scripts to do some of the more menial data science work>";

So last summer when I was given the opportunity to travel to Kunming, China and study for a half semester at Yunnan University I jumped on it! While I started formal Mandarin studies the year before, I was not at all prepared for the demands of total immersion. That being said, apart from once trying to order milk tea from a Dumpling shop... I did reasonably okay! Spending mornings in class and afternoons exploring the city with local language partners it really was an unforgettable experience.";

After Freshman year, I joined a Northeastern program that spent a month exploring Italy. Focusing on science and technological developments after the Roman Empire, we spent a lot of the time learning about the Rennaissance and the many revolutions of the time period. Be it the expansive influence of Da Vinci or the economics of coffee, there was always something new to learn. I really do hope to get back some day.";

Personally, I'm more interested in the nearby orchards, driving to Taco Bell at 2 A.M. for some Baja Blast, going downtown to play firsbee in the park, or kayaking in the Summer. I think Saratoga is a fantastic town to grow up in, and I still try to visit home whenever I can.";

I feel it's important to find a balance. ";
