			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Welcome to the Karn processing plant!</p>
			<p>Normally we don't give tours...(OSHA didn't excatly give us a glowing recommendation)...but apparently you greased the right palms! Anyway, we're a family run operation that processes Magic the Gathering&trade; card data and outputs lists of card names and prices based on the input.</p>
			<p>With the help of minor manual labor on the human's part, once a card is inserted into the loading bay
	our optical array focused through three reading glass lenses will take a picture and crop it to only include the card name.</p>
			<p>This data is then uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket and processed through the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/">Rekognition</a> service. Using the image-to-text feature, the card name is pulled from the supplied picture and sent back to the program.</p>
			<p>After we receive the card name, a team of our finest engineers creates an API call to <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/api">Scryfall</a> for the current price of the supplied card and returns that data to the end user. If no match can be found, a second picture is taken and the process repeats up to five times before giving up.</p>
			<p>Once a card has been successfully processed and logged, a servo dumps the positoned card into the reclamation bay and a new card can be inserted into processing. This process will continue until the program is quit or interrupted depending on if automatic card dumping or manual is selected.</p>
			<h2>Limitations</h2>
			<p>One of the biggest issues with this design is the ignoring of set symbols. While that is a feature we would love to include in a Karn processing plant down the line, the image recognition for each set symbol would require an ML enterprise we currently don't have the bandwidth to undertake. In the meantime, Scryfall simply returns the lowest cost associated with that particular card assuming the prices will generally be in the same ballpark between printings.</p>
			<p>We generally employ a staff of about six for day-to-day operation: Servo operator, Image Processing Engineer, Breadboard Security, Technic Structural Engineer, PR Representative, and a Site Manager. There is a very high turnover rate due to the more exposed design and no real safety equipment of any kind so we're always hiring!</p>
